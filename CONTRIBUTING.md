# Simplified Coding
## Contribution Guidelines
Authored by Odysseus Kirikopoulos

# Introduction
These Contribution Guidelines have been authored by The Simplified Coding Team to outline the development process contributors should follow. We want to say how much we appreciate people who contribute and want to contribute to Simplified Coding. All contributions, small or big, are vital for keeping the project running. To make this process as smooth as possible, we recommend that all contributors read these guidelines before they get started.

# Prerequisites
You can contribute to Simplified Coding in any way you want. The project uses Astro as its base and Bootstrap as its CSS framework*. Our lessons are in markdown format (specifically MDX), and we use the Pyodide project for our Python execution and Codemirror for the code editor. 

If you want to make a change to the contents of Simplified Coding, you are going to need some Greek knowledge. For example, if you want to create a new course, you need adequate Greek knowledge to write it!

As always your changes need to be compliant with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/simplified-coding/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# How to contribute
If this is the first time you are contributing on GitHub, here’s a quick rundown of what you need to do [1]:

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub user. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under your-github-username/repository-name.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.your-github-username/repository-name.git
4. Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here.
5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
6. Use git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here or git add * to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
7. Use git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here" to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
8. Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.
9. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
10. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".
11. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), we help you fix any problems and improve it!
12. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by The Simplified Coding Team.
13. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
14. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!

# The review process
Once you submit your Pull Request, The Simplified Coding Team will be notified and schedule a meeting to review it. The meeting will be recorded for transparency, and there are three possible outcomes. The Simplified Coding either approves your PR and merges it, rejects it and closes it or requests changes. In the last case, we will write a description of the change required for the change to be approved. After the changes have been made, we will approve the PR and merge it.
